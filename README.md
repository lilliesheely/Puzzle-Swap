# <div align="center">NEIGHBORHOOD PUZZLE SWAP</div>
Neighborhood puzzle swap is an online application where people nearby Russian Hill, San Francisco can see a list of available puzzles to borrow in their neighborhood. Users can upload their own puzzles to offer others and view puzzles that others have contributed. Users can request a puzzle by messaging the puzzle owner, where a message page will display all messages between the owner and the requester of the puzzle for that specific puzzle.

## <div align="center">Future Upgrades</div>
- [ ] Create an 'on-loan' feature, where the owner can mark the puzzle as 'on-loan' and it will no longer display in the puzzle index as an available puzzle. 
- [ ] Send an email to a user when they receive a new message.
- [ ] Expand to more neighborhoods and create filters for 'nearby'. 
- [ ] Create schemas for more types of items to lend/borrow (i.e. books, misc household items, etc).
